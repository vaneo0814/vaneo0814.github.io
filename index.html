    <h2>2 reasons why dogs are the best pets</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>They make sure no food ever goes to waste-</strong> If you're full up from dinner but can’t stand the thought of tipping any leftovers into the rubbish, your furry little dustbin is always on hand to help.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>They make you active –</strong> even when you really, really can’t be bothered to go for a stroll, the necessity of ‘walkies’ means you've just got to get out there. And you always feel glad that you’ve had the exercise.</li>
    </ul>
